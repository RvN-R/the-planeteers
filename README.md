## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
Our goal of the project was to design and create an informative, fun, interactive website and bring knowledge and awareness of how important it is to take care of our planet, not just for our generation, but for the generations ahead.- The website contains our group logo, “The Planeteers”, “Home”, with “Game” and “About Us” linking to additional pages. Also, each page consists of a matching footer page with social networking links, blue for recycle and turn green on hover, for the user going the “green” option to find out more. The social networking links are set for their respective home pages for the moment. Additional links are provided for other external sources used.- The Home page consists of 3 sections that are “Air”, “Land” and “Water”.  

* **AIR**: Clean air to breath.  
* **LAND**: Good land to grow crops.  
* **WATER**: Clean, fresh water to drink. Conserving our natural resources, air, land and water quality.

### Color Scheme
From the outset of building this site we wanted to take its key design features from the colours of nature. The colours we used on the site had to reflect the sites demographics values, that of improving the environment. Using as a team we collaborated on what colour scheme would aid us in connecting with our intended audience. To achieve this we used a website called [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), experimenting with difference colour pallets ultimately settling on the below list of colours:

* #1f6fa4 - Honolulu Blue

* #246F75 - Ming

* #072110 - Phthalo Green

* #236823 - Pakistan Green

* #64B334 - Green Ryb

<br>

### Typography

Bangers and Rubik are the two fonts we have chosen for use across the site. We wanted the site to appeal to a younger audience, while including content to help improve an older demographics (parents/carers of said younger audiences) understanding of recycling and methods to help improve the environment. This was a tricky task and a difficult balance to find, but both fonts with there child like and comic book features helped us appeal to our younger demographic.

### Wireframes

## Testing User Stories from UX section in README

<br>

### Testing First Time Visitor Goals

1. **As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site, and learn more about the game.**

-   At the top of the Home Page is a paragraph informing the visitor of the sites and games values. With regard to learning more about the game, once the user clicks "Game" in the navigation bar there is a call to action button titled "Tutorial". Once clicked a modal appears explaining the rules of the game. 

2.  **As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find key content..**

-   At the top of each page is a navigation bar that runs the length of the page. It's fixed at the top of the page and allows the visitor, no matter where they are on the website, to know the location of the navigation bar.

3.  **As a First Time Visitor, I want to clearly find out how play the game**

-   Once the user arrives at the home page they will be presented with two call to action buttons, one entitled "Game" and the other entitled "Tutorial". By clicking the call to action button titled "Tutorial" a modal appears explaining the rules of the game. 

4.  **As a First Time Visitor, I want learn useful and informative facts on the benefits of recycling**

-   When the user arrives at the home page when they scroll down the page they will see very clearly in Bangers font the headings "Did You Know?" and "How Can You Make a Difference?". Each heading is in its own section with different background images. These images help clarify to the visiter that these sections cover different topics. Underneath each heading are four cards, with interesting facts, and images relating to these facts. The facts themselves are small, easy to understand and provide real value to visitor of the site. 

<br>

### Testing Returning Visitor Goals

<br>

1.  **As a Returning Visitor, I want to navigate to the game page quickly.**

-   We have fixed the navigation bar to the top of the site, meaning no matter where the user is on the site they will be able to easily navigate around the site.

2.  **As a Returning Visitor, I want to learn about the team behind the site and game**

-   The user can easily navigate to the About Us page using the onsite navigation. Once on the About Us page the user will see six cards with hover effects. Once the user hovers over the images of our avatars information on each team member and the overall team will appear. 

<br>

### Testing Frequent Visitor Goals

<br>

1.  **As a Frequent User, I want to be able access the sources of the facts featured on the home page, so I can learn more on the subject.**

-   The validity of the facts we have included on our site was of paramount importance to us. Not  only because we want to make sure what we are informing the users of our site is correct, but to also provide them an opportunity to further read up on the subject should they find it interesting. At the bottom of each page
-
